The network topology was designed and simulated in GNS3. </br>
The automation client is a PC running Ubuntu through which the Network administrator can
remotely manage Network Devices on the Network. </br>
For this demo the Router was the target device.

The script lets you configure the following on the router;

- telnet credentials to login
- Loopback address
- OSPF Area
